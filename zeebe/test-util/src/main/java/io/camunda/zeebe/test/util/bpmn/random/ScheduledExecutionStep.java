/**
 * Class that schedules an execution step to run at a certain time.
 *
 * <p>"Time" here means a scheduled execution time.
 *
 * <p>To summarize, we distinguish the following points in time: _scheduledActivationTime_ this is
 * the time when a BPMN element is activated.
 *
 * <p>An element might be activated, but its execution step(s) might be scheduled later. E.g. a
 * parallel gateway will activate 2 or more elements, but only once of them will be executed next.
 * The others are executed later. This is captured in
 *
 * <p>_scheduledExecutionStartTime_ this is the time when an execution step will be executed.
 *
 * <p>_deltaTime_ the time the execution step will take
 *
 * <p>_scheduledExecutionEndTime_ this is the time when the execution of a step is finished.
 *
 * <p>Distinguishing the activation vs. the execution time is important for calculating correct
 * values for timeouts.
 *
 * <p>For a broader discussion, please consult https://github.com/camunda/camunda/issues/6568 which
 * discusses the problem and the concept.
